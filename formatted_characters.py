intro = f"{square_bullet_point1} Introduction:<br> Findings from the experiment comparing two versions of websites. The goal was to see if the new version could increase the number of customers making purchases."
evaluation = f"{square_bullet_point1} The Experiment:<br> We conducted an experiment with two groups of 500 visitors each:<br>{circle_bullet_point}Group A used the old version of our website.<br>{circle_bullet_point}Group B used the new version of our website.<br><br>{square_bullet_point1}The Results:<br {circle_bullet_point}In Group A, 4.4% of visitors made a purchase.<br>{circle_bullet_point}In Group B, 7.45% of visitors made a purchase. <br>{circle_bullet_point}What Does This Mean? At first glance, it looks like the new website is performing better. But to be sure, we used a statistical test to see if this difference is significant or just due to random chance.<br>{circle_bullet_point}The Statistical Test: This new App calculated a p-value, which helps us understand the likelihood that the difference we observed is real and not just a fluke. In this case, the p-value was 0.04 (or 4.41%)."
insights =f"{square_bullet_point1}Example Insights and Interpreting the p-value:<br>{circle_bullet_point}A p-value less than 0.05 (5%) means we can be confident that the difference is significant.
